# Photoshop-Project
1)	Image Source:

While we both had a great selection of pictures from our past, we decided as Ireland and Galway in particular is a fresh start for both of us hence we should take a picture from here and reflect upon it in our project. We chose the location of Eyre Street to take our click for two reasons. Firstly, it’s kind of a hallmark for the city as the most recognized street due to its rich array of pubs, street music, restaurants, buildings and various shops in short quintessential depiction of Irish culture. Secondly, at the end of the street there is a junction that is very important to the story that we want to tell you through our picture. 

The final image that will be seen is a combination of three images from different angles shot through the lens of a mobile phone camera which are then cropped and manipulated to represent the message we wanted to give through the image.

2)	Aim:

This image and its subsequent manipulation tells a story of two nationals from India and Pakistan, both countries that are divided not just by boundaries but by a history that revolves around wars, diplomatic breakdowns and lots and lots of distrust and ill will. Through our image we wanted to send a message of peace and friendship to our country men and portray to them that despite the factious differences between the countries we two have made the effort to move pass them and form a strong bond of friendship, mutual respect and shared admiration of each other in a foreign land. Hashir from India and Mudassir from Pakistan but we both chose not to represent our sides but embrace each other’s and we signified this through the positioning of the flags of both countries in the sky.

The intersection of the two streets in the middle, the sweet Irish street musician and the color contrast ambience of the vintage style street shops and buildings in the image complete the story we wanted to tell, as we see this junction and the city street as the focal point of our new friendship and a beautiful depiction of how our two paths collided in a stunning foreign land like Galway. This city and the country has given us the chance to embrace the rich Irish culture together and forge a bond that will last for many years to come.











3)	Steps Taken For Manipulation Of Image In Photoshop:

•	Selection of three images with different angles from a mobile phone camera.
•	With the help of Spot healing brush tool and patch tool we removed the parts not wanted in the image like (Wires and poles).
•	The three images were photo merged and made it into a single image after cropping through the usage of skew tool, crop tool and spot healing brush tool.
•	Indian Flag was created using the rectangle and elliptical tools and the Asoka Chakra in the centre of the flag required using the centre of rotation and setting it to 15 degree and additionally elliptical tool too. 3 rectangles and 26 ellipses were used to make the complete flag which then were all merged and made into a single layer. The single layer was then converted to smart object. 
•	Pakistani Flag was made with the help of custom shape tool that included 5 point star and crescent moon. 2 rectangles and 2 custom shapes are used to make the complete flag which then were all merged and made into a single layer. The single layer was then converted to smart object.
•	Quick selection tool was used to select the right half of the sky and after that refine edge feature was used to make the selection better which was then saved by the name right sky in PSD file.
•	Same above application of feature was used for left half of the sky too but the selection was saved as left sky in PSD file.
•	Then we used layer mask and loaded the right half sky selection and adjusted the Indian flag inside. Same was done with the Pakistani flag but left half sky was selected.
•	To color match the Indian flag with the sky we used “overlay blending mode” and adjusted the opacity to better the image and with the Pakistani flag the application was same but “blending mode darken was used.”
•	A new brush (Brush no 613) was created to extract and recreate a flock of birds from another image. 
•	Brush no 613 was then used to input the selected flock of birds in the background of the flags.
•	Adjustment layers like brightness/contrast, hue saturation, vibrance and levels were used to color match the image.
•	We increased the richness of color in the buildings to give it a modern look using hue saturation.
•	Another adjustment layer (Black & White) was created and applied on the complete image, and then we used layer masking with the help of brush tool to separate the part that we wanted in color and the rest in grey scale. We tried using the motion blur filter but the image was not looking as per our expectations hence we left that idea.
•	Layer masking with soft light blend was used to enhance the faces of the three people in focus.
•	With the help of horizontal type tool we wrote text in the picture and used the stylized/emboss filter to engrave the text on the road.

4)	Advance Image Manipulation Techniques

Photo Merge Technique:
The advanced image manipulation technique we used was photo merging. Photo merging happens when multiple images have to be merged together to create a single aligned image. In our case as we didn’t have a professional digital camera so we had to improvise and use a mobile camera to click an image. We clicked three images in three different angles with the phone camera. To incorporate the entire capture of the three angles into one single combine image we used photo merging. 
There is an option in file menu, automate sub menu and then there is an option there photo merge. Select the three image files and it will create a single merged image, this process is technically merging three layers and creating one singular layer.
With the use of skew tool apply a free horizontal or vertical slant to an image and also free transform to fit in window. To crop unwanted objects use the crop tool. We also used sponge healing tool to make some correction in image where some pixels were missing. Finally we merged all the layers to one.

New brush tool:
Choose any design /pattern or take it from any other image source. And then create a new layer. Select the part that you want to be in the brush using any lasso tool or any other selection tool. There is one option in edit menu, define brush preset. Name the brush. Now select brush tool and scroll to last, you will see your newly created brush pattern. The new brush tool (no.613) we created was used to create the flock of birds.

Smart objects:
Smart Objects are layers that contain image data from raster or vector images, such as Photoshop or files from Illustrator. Smart Objects preserve an image’s source content with all its original features, enabling the user to execute non-destructive editing to the layer. We created smart objects in the form of India, Pakistan Flag and flock of birds.

Clipping Layer:
The clipping layer is used to attach a particular feature to a selected layer. This was used as a making tool in the Pakistani Flag so that its image effect should not get mixed with other layers.
